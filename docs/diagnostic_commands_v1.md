# MyExpenses Project: Diagnostic & Execution Command Guide

This document records all commands executed to run, diagnose, and fix issues in the MyExpenses Go project. Each command is explained with **why**, **when**, **what** it does, and **expected output**. Use this as a learning and troubleshooting reference for future development.

---

## 1. Initial Setup & Dependency Management

### 1.1. Download Go Dependencies
```bash
go mod tidy
```
- **Why:** Ensures all required Go modules are downloaded and the `go.mod`/`go.sum` files are up to date.
- **When:** After cloning the repo or adding new dependencies.
- **Expected Output:** No errors if all dependencies are available. Warnings if any modules are missing.

---

## 2. Database Setup (PostgreSQL with Docker)

### 2.1. Start Docker (if not running)
```bash
open -a Docker
```
- **Why:** Docker must be running to start containers.
- **When:** Before running any Docker commands on macOS.
- **Expected Output:** No output if Docker starts successfully.

### 2.2. Start PostgreSQL Container
```bash
docker run -d --name postgres-expenses \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=myexpenses \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15-alpine
```
- **Why:** Launches a PostgreSQL database for the app to connect to.
- **When:** Before running the Go application.
- **Expected Output:** Container ID if successful. If image is missing, Docker will pull it.

### 2.3. Fixing Database Not Found Errors
If you see:
```
FATAL: database "myexpenses" does not exist (SQLSTATE 3D000)
```
Run:
```bash
docker rm -f postgres-expenses
docker volume prune -f
```
- **Why:** Removes the old container and its data volume to ensure a fresh start.
- **When:** If the database was not created or the container is corrupted.
- **Expected Output:** Confirmation of container and volume removal.

Then, restart the container as in 2.2.

---

## 3. Running the Go Application

### 3.1. Run the Application
```bash
go run cmd/api/main.go
```
- **Why:** Starts the API server.
- **When:** After database is running and dependencies are installed.
- **Expected Output:**
  - Success: Logs indicating server is running (e.g., `Starting server on port 8080`).
  - Failure: Error messages about database connection, missing files, or code issues.

### 3.2. Common Error: Empty or Invalid Go File
If you see:
```
internal/db/db.go:1:1: expected 'package', found 'EOF'
```
- **Why:** An empty or invalid Go file exists (here, `internal/db/db.go`).
- **Fix:** Delete or correct the file.
```bash
rm internal/db/db.go
```
- **Expected Output:** File is removed. Application should now start if no other errors.

---

## 4. Diagnosing Application Status

### 4.1. Check if Application is Running
```bash
ps aux | grep "go run" | grep -v grep
```
- **Why:** Verifies if the Go application is running in the background.
- **When:** If you're unsure whether the server is active.
- **Expected Output:** Process details if running, nothing if not.

### 4.2. Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
```
- **Why:** Confirms the API server is up and responding.
- **When:** After starting the server.
- **Expected Output:** JSON response like `{ "status": "ok", "service": "MyExpenses API" }`.

---

## 5. Testing API Endpoints

### 5.1. Create an Expense
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/expenses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description":"Coffee","amount":4.50,"category":"Food","date":"2024-01-15T08:00:00Z"}'
```
- **Why:** Tests the POST endpoint for creating expenses.
- **Expected Output:** JSON with the created expense and a success message.

### 5.2. Get All Expenses
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/expenses
```
- **Why:** Tests the GET endpoint for retrieving all expenses.
- **Expected Output:** JSON array of expenses.

### 5.3. Get Expense by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/expenses/{id}
```
- **Why:** Tests the GET endpoint for a specific expense.
- **Expected Output:** JSON object for the expense with the given ID.

### 5.4. Update an Expense
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/expenses/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":5.00}'
```
- **Why:** Tests the PUT endpoint for updating an expense.
- **Expected Output:** JSON with the updated expense and a success message.

### 5.5. Delete an Expense
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/expenses/{id}
```
- **Why:** Tests the DELETE endpoint for removing an expense.
- **Expected Output:** JSON with a success message.

---

## 6. General Troubleshooting

- **Check Docker is running:**
  - If you see `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`, start Docker Desktop.
- **Check for empty or invalid Go files:**
  - Remove or fix files that cause `expected 'package', found 'EOF'` errors.
- **Check logs for errors:**
  - Application logs will indicate missing dependencies, database issues, or code errors.
- **Remove and recreate containers if needed:**
  - Use `docker rm -f <container>` and `docker volume prune -f` to reset state.

---

## 7. Future Diagnostics

- **Document every new command and its purpose.**
- **Add new troubleshooting steps as you encounter new issues.**
- **Keep this file updated for team learning and onboarding.**

## Quick Reference Commands

### Essential Commands for Daily Use

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker run -d --name postgres-expenses -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=myexpenses -p 5432:5432 postgres:15-alpine

# Start application
go run cmd/api/main.go

# Test health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .

# Check database
docker exec postgres-expenses psql -U postgres -d myexpenses -c "\dt"

# Stop and clean up
docker stop postgres-expenses && docker rm postgres-expenses
```

### Emergency Commands

```bash
# Force stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Clean up volumes
docker volume prune -f

# Kill all Go processes
pkill -f "go run"
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always check container status first** before troubleshooting application issues
2. **Use specific database names** to avoid confusion with other PostgreSQL instances
3. **Test connectivity from both container and host** to isolate network issues
4. **Check logs immediately** when containers or applications fail to start
5. **Use pretty-printed JSON** (`jq`) for better debugging of API responses
6. **Keep diagnostic commands handy** for quick troubleshooting
7. **Document any custom configurations** that might affect the setup

---

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `database "myexpenses" does not exist` | Database not created or wrong PostgreSQL instance | Check container logs, recreate container |
| `connection refused` | Port conflict or service not running | Check port usage, restart service |
| `port already in use` | Another service using the port | Kill conflicting process or change port |
| `compilation failed` | Missing dependencies or syntax errors | Run `go mod tidy`, fix code |
| `table does not exist` | AutoMigrate failed | Check application logs, restart application |

This diagnostic guide should help you quickly identify and resolve most issues with the MyExpenses API service.
